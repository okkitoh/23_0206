random radius
random angle
convert from polar to cartesian coordinates.
x = r * cos (theta)
y = r * sin (theta)

In model space, cone is defined as having a base with radius r centered at origin.
The height h of the cone moves up along the y+ axis to form the apex per unity's preferred 
axis orientation.

Because we're using script attached to gameobject, we get nice luxury of
handling all particle rotations at once in view space rather than model space.
